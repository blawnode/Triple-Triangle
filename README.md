# Triple-Triangle
Between 2021 and 2022, I set to make a simple, whole game.


And so, I've made _Triple Triangle_.


itch.io page and .apk download: https://blawnode.itch.io/threeangle


### The Game
You control three triangular spikes, and pop enemy circles, moving towards the top of the screen.


The game features:
* A main menu and a settings menu.
* A tutorial.
* A shop, with "skins".
* Ads to get coins.
* Scene transitions.

### The Idea
I knew that I want to put no effort in art assets, nor sound.


I also knew that I wanted to make a game similar to KetchApp's creations. Namely, "Don't Touch the Spikes" - A favourite of mine.


The idea for Triple Triangle, thus, slowly evolved.
